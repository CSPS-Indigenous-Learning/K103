					<p>The <strong>Nunavut Land Claims Agreement</strong> was signed in 1993. This agreement led to the <em>Nunavut Act</em>, which paved the way for the new territory of Nunavut in 1999. Inuit received control of lands and resources, as well as considerable control in areas normally handled by the Government of Canada. The agreement also created a public legislature for all residents of the territory—including Inuit (85% of residents) and non-Inuit. Today, Nunavut operates in most ways like a province, with additional benefits and responsibilities coming from the agreement.</p>
					<p>The Lesislative Assembly of Nunavut is one of two legislatures in Canada that has a <strong>consensus style of government</strong> (the other being the Northwest Territories):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There are no political parties; when elections are held in Nunavut, every candidate runs as an independent candidate</li>
						<li>After the election, all elected members gather together to select the speaker, premier and ministers in a secret ballot</li>
						<li>Not all members can be a minister, to ensure that there is always a voice to hold decisions to account</li>
						<li>the premier can be removed from the position by a majority vote of the legislature—unlike most Canadian jurisdictions</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Located in Northern Quebec, Inuit in this region signed the <strong>James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement</strong> in 1978. From that agreement, the Kativik Regional Government was created. This regional government is funded by the Government of Quebec, the Government of Canada and internal sources. It is recognized as a municipal government by Quebec.</p>

					<p>The <strong>Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement</strong> came into effect in 2005. This agreement between the Government of Canada and the Labrador Inuit recognized self-government in the Nunatsiavut region of Northern Labrador.</p>
					<p>The Government of Nunatsiavut has the authority to make laws in the areas of natural resources, health, education, culture and language, justice and community matters. Members from five Inuit communities make up the legislature. The area is still part of Newfoundland and Labrador and works in partnership with the provincial government in the best interests of its members.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>The Government of Canada and the Inuvialuit signed a comprehensive land claim agreement in 1984 that covers the northwest portion of the Northwest Territories. In the <strong>Inuvialuit Final Agreement</strong>, Inuvialuit agreed to give up their exclusive use of their ancestral lands in exchange for certain guaranteed rights in the areas of land, wildlife management and money.</p>
					<p>Local Inuvialuit corporations have been created to administer the details of the agreement in the territory and manage relations with the Government of Canada and the Northwest Territories. This is not a self-government agreement; however, Inuvialuit and the federal government are continuing to negotiate to this end.</p>

					<p>As a public service employee, you need to ensure that your work meets the requirements of these land claims agreements. For example,</p>
					<ul>
						<li>when there is contracting of federal work in treaty territory, certain accommodations may need to be made under some treaties for Inuit companies to apply</li>
						<li>if you are providing a national service, you need to take into consideration the specific needs in that area—a single standard for all of Canada is no longer justifiable</li>
					</ul>
