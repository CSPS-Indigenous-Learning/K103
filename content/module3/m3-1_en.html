    <p>Inuit banded together collectively into four regions to negotiate and sign comprehensive land claims agreements with the Government of Canada. They were spurred on by concerns over:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the well-being of the land and wildlife</li>
        <li>the growing number of mining, oil and gas developments</li>
        <li>government interests</li>
        <li>the development of mineral resources</li>
        <li>land and resource ownership in Inuit&nbsp;Nunangat&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each treaty that was signed is unique and contains its own specific benefits and obligations. All of the treaties have implications for the Government of Canada. None of the agreements changed the fundamental citizenship of Inuit, who are all Canadians with the same rights and entitlements.</p>
