		<p>Traditionally, Inuit communities contained 100 to 1000 members. The most important social and political unit was the regional band. Several bands together constituted the larger Inuit groups in which marriages occurred and all members spoke a similar dialect.</p>
		<p>Today, Inuit society is in transition—Inuit have lived in permanent settlements for only a short time. These settlements, normally called hamlets, blend with traditional family structures and contemporary systems.</p>
		<p>Inuit are all under a modern treaty, except for those who moved out of Inuit&nbsp;Nunangat&nbsp;to southern communities. The four regions of the Canadian Arctic—Nunavik in Quebec, Nunatsiavut in Labrador, Inuvialuit in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut—have distinct governance structures ranging from the public government of Nunavut, to the treaty provisions and municipal status of Nunavik in Quebec, to the slightly more limited comprehensive land claim in Inuvialuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the regions have control over their own lands and work hard to determine their own futures.</p>
