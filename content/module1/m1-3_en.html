    <h1>Who are Inuit?</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">
    <p>Inuit were here long before the creation of Canada and continue to thrive today. Inuit do not call themselves First Nations. Rather, they see themselves as a <strong>distinct group</strong> with their own culture, spirituality, language and know-how.</p>
    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <p>Inuit speak many different languages and dialects. However, all Inuit languages come from one main language family: the Inuit-Aleut or Eskimo-Aleut language family. The languages can be grouped into a Western branch and an Eastern branch, which are then further divided into other languages and dialects.</p>
    <h2> Western branch (Yupik languages)</h2>
    <p>Yupik is divided into three distinct languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Central Alaskan Yupik</li>
        <li>Pacific Gulf Yupik (Alaska)</li>
        <li>Siberian Yupik (Canada and Alaska)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these three languages has several dialects.</p>
    <h2>Eastern branch (Inuktitut languages)</h2>
    <p>Eastern branch languages have three different names for the same language:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inuktitut (in Canada)</li>
        <li>Inupiaq (in Alaska)</li>
        <li>Kalaallisut (in Greenland)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many dialects of this language are spoken in the three countries.</p>
