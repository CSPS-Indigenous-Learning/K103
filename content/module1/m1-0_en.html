	<h2>What’s in a name?</h2>
	<p>Inuit are the Indigenous peoples of the Arctic. The word Inuit means “the people” in the Inuit language of Inuktitut.</p>
	<p>Until recently, people used the word “Eskimo”. However, in Canada,&nbsp;“Eskimo” is often considered a derogatory term.&nbsp;The respectful and more commonly used term is Inuit. The&nbsp;singular form of Inuit is Inuk, meaning person.</p>
	<p>We use “Inuit” in this course except in the context of legislation and historical documents or in situations where the word “Eskimo” appears.&nbsp;The term “Aboriginal” will also come up in certain contexts such as quotes.</p>

			<p>Inuit, as spelled out in Inuit writing syllabics,&nbsp;means “the people” in&nbsp;<strong>Inuktitut</strong>.</p>
			<p>In English, the word “Inuit” should not be preceded by “the” or followed by “people” in common usage.</p>
