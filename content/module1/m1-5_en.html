    <h1>Getting to know Inuit culture</h1>
    <p>Inuit have always been <strong>innovative</strong> and <strong>resourceful</strong> in facing the challenges of their environment. For example, Inuit created the <strong>kayak</strong>, a single-person watercraft made of scavenged driftwood, whale bone and marine mammal skins. Traditionally, kayaks allowed Inuit hunters to move freely in the difficult waters of the Arctic. Today, they are used throughout the world for recreation and sports competitions.</p>
    <p>Here are a few iconic Inuit cultural symbols and practices. There are many more to discover!</p>
