	<p>As European traders and missionaries made contact with Inuit, <a href="#glossaryTuberculosis" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">tuberculosis</a> spread through trade goods and physical proximity. The impact of the disease was magnified by the communal housing arrangements of Inuit. It became an <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-10" class="external">epidemic</a> that swept through many communities. An estimated <strong>one third of Inuit suffered from tuberculosis during the 1950s</strong>. </p>
	<p>When the Government of Canada started to take action against tuberculosis, Inuit who suffered from the disease, including children, were quickly removed from their communities and sent to sanatoriums in the south:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This often happened with no discussion or warning to the people who were removed</li>
		<li>They were sent to southern health centres where they did not speak the language or even recognize the food</li>
		<li>Many never returned to their community, and many families were left not knowing the fate of their loved ones</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In 2010, the Government of Canada in partnership with Inuit established a program called <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-11" class="external">Nanilavut: Letâ€™s find them</a>. A database of relevant information was created to help find missing people who had been sent away for medical treatment.</p>
	<p>Effective treatments for tuberculosis now exist, but the disease remains a significant reality in the North. The average annual rate of tuberculosis for Inuit in Canada is more than <strong>290 times higher than for Canadian-born non-Indigenous people</strong>. This can be traced back to poor living conditions such as overcrowding and badly maintained houses. Lack of access to complete medical care is also a factor.</p>
