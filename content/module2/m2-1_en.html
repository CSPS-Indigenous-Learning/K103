	<p>For the next two hundred years, the Hudson’s Bay Company, whalers and explorers were the main European contacts for some Inuit such as the&nbsp;Kivallirmiut&nbsp;or Caribou Inuit in Nunavut. Christian missionaries also arrived to spread their religion, often pushing aside traditional beliefs and practices.</p>
	<p>Trading with the Europeans provided the&nbsp;Kivallirmiut&nbsp;with firearms and allowed them to hunt caribou more efficiently. Through the Hudson’s Bay Company, they had access to manufactured goods, foodstuffs and tools that helped them in their day-to-day lives.</p>
	<p>However, by the early 20th century, the population of&nbsp;Kivallirmiut&nbsp;was nearly decimated. The reasons included the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Many Inuit left and travelled south to follow the caribou and trade furs with the Europeans</li>
		<li>Inuit came into contact with European diseases</li>
		<li>Caribou became scarce due to overhunting and the disruption of their habitat by Europeans</li>
	</ul>
	<p>From 1915 to about 1924, a severe famine killed nearly two thirds of the population. At this point, Inuit became increasingly dependent on European trade.</p>
