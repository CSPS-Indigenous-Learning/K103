        <p>In 2010, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-8" class="external">apologized to Inuit families</a> who had been relocated in the 1950s to the High Arctic:</p>
        <blockquote>&ldquo;We would like to express our deepest sorrow for the extreme hardship and suffering caused by the relocation. The families were separated from their home communities and extended families by more than a thousand kilometers. They were not provided with adequate shelter and supplies. They were not properly informed of how far away and how different from Inukjuak their new homes would be, and they were not aware that they would be separated into two communities once they arrived in the High Arctic. Moreover, the Government failed to act on its promise to return anyone that did not wish to stay in the High Arctic to their old homes.&rdquo;</blockquote>
