<h1>Inuit and Residential Schools</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">
<p>Starting in 1951, Inuit children were sent to residential schools like First Nations children. As Inuit moved into permanent settlements, the childrenâ€™s attendance at residential schools became mandatory.</p>
<p>In 1964, <strong>75% of Inuit children attended a residential school</strong>. Residential schools systematically undermined Inuit culture across Canada and disrupted families for generations. They severed the ties through which Inuit culture is taught and sustained and contributed to a <strong>general loss of language and culture</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of the survival skills necessary for life in the North were passed down from adult to child through hands-on experience. With the children away from their homes and family, <strong>these skills were not transferred to the next generation</strong>. When the children returned home from the schools, they found themselves <strong>lacking necessary skills. </strong>This accelerated the move away from traditional lifestyles and increased dependence on government support.</p>
