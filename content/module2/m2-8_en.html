		<p>When snow and ice cover the ground and water, travel is difficult in the North and often dangerous. Inuit bred and raised dogs to pull a sled and carry a load in these conditions.</p>
		<p>European traders and missionaries saw the benefit of this efficient and effective mode of transportation and quickly adopted it. Today, these Northern dogs are recognized dog breeds. They include the Alaskan Malamute and the Canadian Eskimo Dog.</p>

		<p>In the 1950s, a series of dog slaughters occurred in Nunavik and Nunavut. This highly controversial situation has been the subject of much dispute between the local Inuit population and government authorities.</p>
		<p>Inuit accused the federal and provincial governments of having deliberately slaughtered the dogs to force Inuit to live in permanent settlements. The governments insisted that the slaughter was undertaken because of the dog diseases in order to ensure public health and safety. </p>
		<p>The real-life impacts of the dog slaughters were significant to Inuit communities. Dogsleds were the main way hunters moved around the terrain. Once this mobility was taken away, and with no other opportunities to provide for themselves, Inuit were forced to turn to the governments for support. Dependence on income assistance became a way of life for this previously heathy population.</p>
		<p>The Government of Quebec has since compensated Quebec Inuit for the dog slaughtersâ€”though their impacts remain. Fortunately, Inuit are regaining the skills required to maintain their dog teams.</p>
