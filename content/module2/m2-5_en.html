	<p>Traditionally, Inuit followed the seasonal patterns of the Arctic and travelled from one area to another to live off the land. They enjoyed a simple life and were well sustained and happy.</p>
	<p>Following the arrival of European traders and missionaries, their lifestyle began to change over the years. Camps were established near trading posts and missionary sites to facilitate trading.</p>
	<p>In the 1950s, the Government of Canada wanted to see Inuit settled in one location. Policies were revised to create communities and villages of permanent residency.</p>
	<p><strong>This government-led initiative resulted in one of the most profound changes to Inuit culture.</strong></p>
	<p>Inuit hunters were used to travelling freely through the terrain by dogsled and kayak to go where the food could be found. They would change their camp locations throughout the year to give better access to food supplies. The Government of Canada was not accustomed to this lifestyle and did not intend to support it. The Government required consistency and permanency to deliver services and exert control.</p>
