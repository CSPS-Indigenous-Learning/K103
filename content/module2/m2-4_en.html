	<h1>Right to vote</h1>
	<p>In 1950, Inuit gained the right to vote in federal electionsâ€”several years before First Nations were granted this privilege. This seemed to have been a progressive move at the time. In reality, it was a hollow benefit.</p>
	<p>Few polling stations, if any, were established in the North. This meant that even though Inuit had the right to vote, the physical ability to do so was not available. In addition, Inuit were not provided with information about Western governance and voting systems, nor did they see the relevancy of voting.</p>
