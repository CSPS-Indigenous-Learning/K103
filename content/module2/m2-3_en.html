	<p>Inuit highly value their naming traditions. For example, they often name a child after a deceased family member to foster closeness within families. Some Inuit believe that when a person passes away, their spirit remains until their name is given to a new-born child. A child named after a grandfather might be called “little father” by his aunts and uncles.</p>
	<p>Europeans <strong>struggled with the various Inuit naming traditions.</strong> The lack of surnames and the inconsistent spellings made it difficult for them to identify each Inuk for trading purposes, census information and other records. In 1941, the Government of Canada chose to register each Inuk with a <strong>unique numeric identifier</strong>, known as the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-5" class="external">“Eskimo disk number”</a> or ujamiit in Inuktitut.</p>
	<p>Eskimo disk numbers were intended to replace the Inuit naming traditions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The numbers were stamped on a disk or printed on a card</li>
		<li>They were often sewn onto clothing or hung from laces around peoples’ necks</li>
		<li>Some Inuit tattooed the number onto their forearms </li>
		<li>Inuit were required to <strong>wear these numbers at all times</strong></li>
		<li>They were expected to use their number when dealing with the government instead of their own name</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The disk numbers were discontinued in the early 1970s in response to the growing resentment of Inuit—they felt the practice had eradicated their personal identities.</p>
