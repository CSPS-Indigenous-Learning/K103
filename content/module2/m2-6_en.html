<div class="col-md-7">
	<p>In 1953, several families from Inukjuak (then known as Port Harrison) in Northern Quebec were transported to Grise Fiord on the southern tip of Ellesmere Island and to Resolute on Cornwallis Island. The families, who had been receiving welfare payments, were promised better living conditions and hunting and fishing opportunities in new communities in the High Arctic.</p>
	<p>Government officials explained to the families that they would be participating in programs to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>address <strong>overpopulation and poor hunting </strong>in certain areas</li>
		<li>reduce their dependency on welfare</li>
		<li>improve their<strong> lifestyle</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The families only learned while they were being transported that they would be left at <strong>three separate locations </strong>and would <strong>not be living together</strong>. The new communities were located in the hostile polar north—a <strong>vastly different environment </strong>than they were accustomed to. In some cases, the animals available to hunt were not the same as where they came from. These conditions made it difficult for them to pursue their usual ways of life. </p>
	<p>This example was not the only one. In 1994, the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-7" class="external">Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</a> issued a report on the relocation program. The report included testimony from Inuit as well as from government officials and historical documents. The Royal Commission concluded that the Inuit had not given free and informed consent to the relocations. The Government of Canada stressed that the “Eskimo problem” was linked to Inuit reluctance to give up their nomadic ways. However, Inuit reported the relocations were <strong>forced</strong> and motivated by a desire to reinforce <strong>Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic</strong> through the creation of settlements.</p>
	<p>Whatever the reason, Inuit were misled and suffered from the Government of Canada’s decision.</p>
