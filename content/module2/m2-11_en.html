					<p><strong>Answer: True.</strong></p>
					<p>In the 1950s, the Government of Canada revised policies that would see Inuit settled in one location.</p>
					<p>Inuit hunters were used to travelling freely through the terrain by dogsled and kayak to go where the food could be found. They would change their camp locations throughout the year to give better access to food supplies. The Government of Canada was not accustomed to this lifestyle and did not intend to support it.</p>
