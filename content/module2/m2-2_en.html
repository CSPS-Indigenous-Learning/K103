	<h1>Inuit, a federal responsibility or not?</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-md-7">
	<p><strong>Inuit were not included in the 1876 <em>Indian Act</em>. </strong>For many years, responsibility for Inuit was transferred from one department to another or between federal and provincial governments.</p>
	<p>In 1924, Inuit came to be considered <strong>Canadian citizens,</strong> rather than wards of the state like First Nations people. The Department of Indian Affairs was assigned responsibility for them.</p>
	<p>In 1939, the Supreme Court of Canada pronounced its judgment on <strong><em>Reference</em> <em>Re Eskimos</em></strong>. Constitutionally, Inuit were to be classified as Indians in Canada under section 91(24) of the <em><a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-4" class="external">Constitution Act, 1867</a></em>. The decision was based on the historical description of "Esquimaux" as an "Indian tribe" in numerous documents dating from 1760 to Confederation.</p>
	<p>The Government of Canada now has jurisdiction to legislate on matters related to Inuit. This does not mean that Inuit have “status” like many First Nations individuals—and <strong>they do not fall under the <em>Indian Act</em></strong>. Instead, the Government of Canada provides programs and services based on specific needs.</p>
