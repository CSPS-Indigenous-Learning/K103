	<h1>Mental health: suicide</h1>
	<p>The impacts of colonialism, socio-economic conditions and significant <!-- <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-18" class="external"> -->risk factors<!-- </a> --> cause many young Inuit to lose hope and resort to suicide. Currently, the suicide rate of Inuit is among the <strong>highest in the world</strong>. It is 11 times the national average.</p>

	<p>Addressing the mental health crisis in Northern communities is a shared responsibility. <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-19" class="external">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami</a> recommends a shared national, regional and community-wide response. It also recommends taking a holistic approach that covers the following areas:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>creating social equity and cultural continuity</li>
		<li>nurturing healthy children</li>
		<li>increasing access to mental wellness services</li>
		<li>addressing unresolved trauma and grief</li>
		<li>mobilizing Inuit knowledge</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Government of Canada has a major role to play. This includes supporting <a href="#" style="white-space:normal;" data-ext="wb-ext-20" class="external">mental health and suicide prevention programs and services</a>. Programs are needed to raise awareness, improve knowledge and skills (of health care workers and community members), provide support for community-based programs and build resilience.</p>
