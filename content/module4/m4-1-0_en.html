	<h2>Loss of traditions</h2>
	<p>Historically, Inuit turned to the land and sea for their sustenance. Traditional foods included whale, walrus, caribou and seal. Inuit also gathered grasses, roots, berries and various types of seaweed for a balanced diet. They led very active lives and were constantly out on the land or maintaining the camps. There was little time for sedentary activities.</p>
	<p>As Inuit started living in permanent settlements, many of the advantages of their traditional lifestyle diminished. There has been a decline in hunting for food, partly because <strong>young people lack the skills to survive off the land</strong>. The high cost of hunting equipment—snowmobiles, rifles, sleds, camping gear, gasoline and oil—is also a major factor.</p>
