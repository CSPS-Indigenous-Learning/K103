	<p>Access to potable water is a significant health issue in Nunangat. The permafrost prevents most communities from having underground water systems, so many rely on water delivery services. All cooking, washing and drinking must be carefully planned to ensure that enough water is available. </p><p><strong>The cost of water services can run into the thousands of dollars per month in some communities.</strong> The cost is so high that some people turn down employment so they wonâ€™t lose access to public housing and subsidized water services.</p>
