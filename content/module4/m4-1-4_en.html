<div class="col-md-7">
	<p>Appropriate housing is also a major concern for Inuit. Inuit no longer live in animal skin shelters or igloos. However, building houses in the permanent settlements of the North is a challenge:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The houses require expensive maintenance</li>
		<li>The materials need to be properly planned and shipped during ice-free months</li>
		<li>The permafrost makes it next to impossible to build a foundation or have an underground water system </li>
	</ul>
	<p>A building in southern communities might last up to 30 years. A building in the North may only last 10 years.</p>
	<p>Much of the housing currently available to Inuit is public housing owned by the local governments. It is only provided to individuals who are deemed to be in need of government assistance. Repairs and maintenance are the governmentâ€™s responsibility.</p>
	<p>The shortage of housing in the North has led to significant health issues. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, <strong>over half of Inuit live in crowded conditions</strong>. Diseases such as <strong>influenza and tuberculosis are transmitted at a much higher rate</strong> in the North than elsewhere in Canada.</p>
	<p>Crowded conditions also put a strain on the buildings themselves. More people and<strong> greater use of utilities</strong> such as bathrooms and kitchens create high humidity conditions and <strong>mould</strong>.</p>
